.LP 
rsa_enc \- an RSA encrypter

.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP 
rsa_enc [ OPTIONS ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The rsa_enc utility encrypts data using the RSA public key crypto system.

.br 
Two encryption modes are available:
.br 
.IP 
Full encryption \- the entire contents of the encrypted file is encrypted by 
RSA processing (modular exponentiation). Encryption and decryption are fairly 
slow.
.br 
.IP 
Quick encryption \- encryption will be done by xoring the file's contents with 
the values of a random number generator sequence generated by some random seed. 
Only the seed itself will be encrypted by RSA processing. As the name 
suggests, encryption and decryption are are quick.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-h \-\-help\fR
Output help information and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-s \-\-scan\fR
Scans the key directory and outputs the available keys.
.TP 
\fB\-x[key] \-\-default[=key]\fR
Set the default public Key. \fIkey\fR is the key name output by the \-\-scan
option. If \fIkey\fR is not provided no default public key is set. Otherwise, 
\fIkey\fR is set as default public key (if it exists).
.TP 
\fB\-p \-\-path\fR
Output the path where where public keys are to be searched. If RSA_KEYPATH is 
set then its value is returned, otherwise it is the current working directory.
.TP 
\fB\-q \-\-quiet\fR
Provide minimal output.
.TP 
\fB\-v \-\-verbose\fR
Provide verbose output.
.TP 
\fB\-f <name> \-\-file=<name>\fR
\fIname\fR is the file to encrypt.
.TP 
\fB\-l <lev> \-\-level=<lev>\fR
Set the encryption level to \fIlev\fR. Supported encryption levels are: 
128(default), 256, 512 and 1024 bits.
.TP 
\fB\-r \-\-rsa\fR
Set full RSA encryption mode. By default, quick RSA encryption mode is used. 
.TP 
\fB\-k <curr> \-\-key=<curr>\fR
Use the public key \fIcurr\fR for the current encryption. This option overrides 
the default public key if it has been set.
.TP 
\fB\-o \-\-original\fR
Keep the file after it has been encrypted. Encryption of file \fIname\fR will 
produce the cypher text \fIname.enc\fR. If the switch is not set, the file 
\fIname\fR will be deleted once it has been encrypted. 
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.LP 
.TP 
\fBRSA_KEYPATH\fP
Specifies the directory where where public RSA keys are searched and scanned.
